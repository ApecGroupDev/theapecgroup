            A gasoline pump is a filling station machine used to pump gasoline (petrol), diesel, or other types of liquid Fuel into vehicles.
            Gasoline pumps are also known as bowsers, petrol bowsers, petrol pumps, and fuel dispensers.

          <p className='text-gray-800 scrn-1000:text-lg whitespace-pre-line mt-3'>
            Gasoline is made when crude oil is broken into various petroleum products by fractional distillation. It is essential to run cars&apos;
            internal combustion engines. The chemical composition of gasoline varies depending on its grade or octane rating, but generally, it
            is a mixture of combustible hydrocarbons. Gasoline is one of the most widely used petroleum products.
          </p>

          <p className='text-gray-800 scrn-1000:text-lg whitespace-pre-line mt-3'>
            The combustion of gasoline is a significant source of human-made carbon dioxide (CO2). The combustion of any fossil fuel and the formation
            of this carbon dioxide negatively impact the earth. It can cause climate change and promote global warming.

            Centrifugal pumps are the most common type in the oil and gasoline industry. The centrifugal pumps use
            centrifugal force through the rotation of the pump impeller. The pump intake and force it through the
            discharge section via centrifugal force. Discharge flow Control Valves control the flow through the pump.

          <p className='text-gray-800 scrn-1000:text-lg whitespace-pre-line mt-3'>
            Centrifugal pumps are primarily used for transferring low-viscosity fluids that require high flow rates.
            They are typically part of a larger pump network comprising other centrifugal pumps. Crude oil shipping is used in secondary oil and gas recovery.

            A fuel pump is a fluid-handling device that moves gasoline from the fuel tank to the engine. It&apos;s often found in internal combustion engines.
            The fuel pump transports gasoline from the tank to the fuel bowl, where the carburetor mixes the Fuel with air and transports it to the
            engineâ€™s combustion chamber.
          </p>

          <p className='text-gray-800 scrn-1000:text-lg whitespace-pre-line mt-3'>
            Large gas tanks underneath all the service pumps at a fuel station. Fuel stations have two or three large tanks, which can hold several
            thousand gallons of gasoline. But for the gas to come up from these tanks into the pump, it must defy gravity.
          </p>

          <p className='text-2xl scrn-1000:text-3xl whitespace-pre-line mt-3 text-[#c62931]'>
            Most gasoline stations use one of two kinds of pumps to get the gas from the storage tanks into the dispenser:
          </p>

          <p className='text-lg scrn-1000:text-xl font-semibold whitespace-pre-line mt-6'>
            1.  Submersible Pump
          </p>
          <p className='text-gray-800 scrn-1000:text-lg whitespace-pre-line'>
            A submersible pump is a deluge below the surface of the liquid. It uses a screw-like device called an impeller to move the Fuel upward into
            the pumps. Skewed blades on the rotating impeller push the liquid away.
          </p>

          <p className='text-lg scrn-1000:text-xl font-semibold whitespace-pre-line mt-6'>
            2.  Suction Pump
          </p>
          <p className='text-gray-800 scrn-1000:text-lg whitespace-pre-line'>
            The system contains an electrical motor, pump, and valves to manage the Fuel. A suction pump moves the gasoline using the principle of
            unequal pressure.  A pipe is inserted into the liquid. The motor above the fluid level removes enough air from the pipe to decrease the
            air pressure above the gasoline. When the air pressure inside the pipe is low enough, the gas climbs into the dispenser.
          </p>

          <p className='text-lg scrn-1000:text-xl font-semibold whitespace-pre-line mt-6'>
            3.  Electronic Monitor

            Electronic monitor, the sensor reading to show fuel volume and pressure details. Fuel monitoring devices provide accurate measurements

            These modest actions should help keep it in good condition. Gasoline doubles as a coolant when used with in-tank pumps.
            If you leave a tank low frequently, your pump will overheat. Fill your tank.
